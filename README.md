# creating_a_game_with_python
The Crossword is a beginner-friendly, picture-based crossword game I build in Python for primary school learners. Players solve themed crosswords (e.g., 5 Senses, Planets, Sports) by looking at images and filling the grid with the correct words. The focus is on spelling, vocabulary, and confidence with gentle feedback.
